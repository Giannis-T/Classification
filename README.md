# Classification

In this project i am classifying restaurant types based on their reviews. I exract embeddings like the TF-IDF, CBOW, Skip-Gram and Doc2Vec from the reviews and using Kfold Cross-Validation i am trainig
classification models like SVM, KNN, Linear Regressor.    
Finally, determine the restaurant types and compare, model and embedding, performances.
